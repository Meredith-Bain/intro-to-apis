## Objectives
Students will be able to:
- articulate the basic functions of an API 
- use the Python requests library to access an API connection
- use the Census API and the Geo IP API
- use documentation to answer questions about using the API
- use specialized client libraries to access an API without using the Python requests library

## First API Call
In this demo, students will see how to access the Geo IP API using the requests library. Using the json library, students will see how to parse the response object. 

## Homework 1
This is the answer key to assignment 1, where students are instructed to request information from Geo IP, parse the response for specified details, and then process them into a CSV. 

## Census API Two Ways
In this demo, students see the value add of a client library, when available, in providing shortcuts on top of the regular API structure.
